ReactJS:-
-----
React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications where content is dynamically updated without requiring a full page reload. Developed by Facebook, React enables developers to create reusable UI components, manage application state efficiently, and optimize performance through techniques like virtual DOM manipulation. It utilizes JSX, a syntax extension that allows HTML-like structures within JavaScript code, simplifying the process of creating and manipulating UI elements. React's component-based architecture promotes modularity and code reusability, making it a popular choice for developing complex and interactive web applications.
